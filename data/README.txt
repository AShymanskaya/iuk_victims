In this folder, anonymized data are provided. 
The file full_sample_data.xlsx contains the following data of the whole sample: confounds, normalized age to improve anonymization, and data from resting state images as well as the measures of gray matter. Variables GM_ contain values of volume, mass, and density in the nodes, which are significantly different between the groups, with the nodes highlighted in Figure 3. Variables RS_ contain significantly different covariance between the groups, with the nodes highlighted in Figure 4. The same data for the sample of subjects with a MINI diagnosis is provided in with_diagnosis_data.xlsx.

Furthermore, the bootstrapped data are exemplarily provided for the sample of subjects with a diagnosis in https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21758462.v1. 

In both cases group 1 corresponds to subjects with experience of violence, while group 2 corresponds to subjects without such experience.
